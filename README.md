# lf-linkedlist

a (bad) lock-free linked list, derived from https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/ & https://marabos.nl/atomics/inspiration.html#lock-free-linked-list. This is "educational" not something anyone should ever use. A lock-free linked-list is a fun
 little side project I've wanted to build for awhile.
